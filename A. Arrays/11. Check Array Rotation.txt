You have been given an integer array(ARR) of size N. It has been sorted(in increasing order) and then rotated by some number 'K' (K is greater than 0) in the right hand direction.
Your task is to write a function that returns the value of 'K', that means, the index from which the array has been rotated.



public class Solution {

    public static int arrayRotateCheck(int[] arr){
        int i;
        
        for(i =0;i<arr.length-1;i++){
            
            if(arr[i]>arr[i+1])
                break;
            
        }
        if (arr.length<=1 || i==(arr.length-1))
            return 0;
        else      
         return i+1;
    }

}
